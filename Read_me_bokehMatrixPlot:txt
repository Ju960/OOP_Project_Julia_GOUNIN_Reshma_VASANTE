READ ME FOR BOKEHMATRIXPLOT

The goal of this file is to show a dynamic matrix with the package bokeh.

We are chosen to use the package bokeh to displate a dynamic matrix, taking genes and clusters as parameters.
When the mouse is over one pixel which contains one gene for one cluster, it's show the number of the cluster, the name of the gene, the mean level of the expression of the gene, the minimum level expression of the gene and the maximum level of expression.
The expression level will be define by a color scale which can be redefine in the code of _bokehMatrixPlot.py.


How to use the file _bokehMatrixPlot.py ?

First, download the file in the folder which contain the part plotting of the package scanpy.
In our case, it's can be the folder "plotting".
Then, run the file "_bokehMatrixPlot.py" in a terminal.
Open a notebook in our folder, and write these lines :

///
from _bokehMatrixPlot import BokehMatrixPlot  // import the function from our file
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Creation of a gene name list from the marker_genes_dict dictionary
gene_list = []                                 // gene_list is to define beforehand
for genes in marker_genes_dict.values():
    gene_list.extend(genes)

# Creation of the BokehMatrixPlot instance with the gene list
bmk_plot = BokehMatrixPlot(pbmc, gene_list, 'cell type') // pbmc is to define beforehand
bmk_plot.to_bokeh()
///


Please go to the README to see how to integrate the desired dataset.
